ZooManager.java
- something is wrong with the food panel; when i leave a number in the
text field, add it to the totals panel and click next, all the numbers are disabled
because the value entered before is still in the text field 

- the first animal is not being seen as an animal with values in it,
so the first animal is being seen as null, so you'd have to bear that in mind

- some of the labels for the totals panel may not be working as expected, so if you
see an error, please notify me as soon as possible 

ZooManager
- the feed buttong is not being enabled when i cycle through the cages 
  I think it being disabled every time an action is performed, so that needs to be taken care of.
- When i add a digit, the other options that are eligible for the particular animal is still
  hightlighted
- the first animal is still not being seen as an actual animal, and is being ignored.
